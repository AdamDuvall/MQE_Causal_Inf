## Module 2: Fixed Effects

- Data Structures

- Fixed Effects

-A simulation

-Fixed effects as demeaned data

-Thinking about variation

-Example: Crime and Unemployment

## Controling for unobservables

We saw with AGG(2006) that even with many covariates, unobservables are a problem. 

Certain types of data allow us to control for more of these unobservables by using fixed effects.

## Example:

$$
Income_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 Schooling_i+\epsilon
$$
