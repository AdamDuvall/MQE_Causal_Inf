## Module 2: Fixed Effects

- Data Structures

- Fixed Effects

-A simulation

-Fixed effects as demeaned data

-Thinking about variation

-Example: Crime and Unemployment

## Controling for unobservables

We saw with AGG(2006) that even with many covariates, unobservables are a problem. 

Certain types of data allow us to control for more of these unobservables by using fixed effects.

## Example:

$$
Income_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 Schooling_i+\epsilon
$$

There are many unobsevables like 'ability', 'enthusiasm' or 'grit' that could bias these estimates. 

What if I can control for all of the unobservable characteristics of an individual, as long as they do not change over time?

## Data Structures

Cross-sectional data: I see each unit once


|Individual    |Income      |Schooling   |Female    |
|--------------|------------|------------|----------|
|1	           |22000       |12          |1         |
|2	           |57000       |16          |1         |
|...	         |...         |...         |...       |
|N	           |15000       |12          |0         |


## Data Structures

Panel Data: I see each unit multiple times


|Individual    |Income      |Schooling   |Female  |Year   |
|--------------|------------|------------|--------|-------|
|1	           |22000       |12          |1       |2001   |
|1	           |23000       |12          |1       |2002   |
|2	           |57000       |16          |1       |2001   |
|2	           |63000       |17          |1       |2002   |
|...	         |...         |...         |...     |...    |
|N	           |15000       |12          |0       |2001   |
|N	           |13000       |12          |0       |2002   |


## Data Structures: Notation

To uniquely identify an observation, I need to know the individual and the time of the observation.

We need to add a new subscript to our estimating equations:

$$
Income_{it}=\beta_0+\beta_1 Schooling_{it}+\epsilon
$$
